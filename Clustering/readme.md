## Clustering Algorithms - Machine Learning Project

Overview

This repository contains implementations of various clustering algorithms in Python using Scikit-Learn. These models are applied to the Mall_Customers.csv dataset to segment customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score.

The clustering methods included in this repository are:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook inside the clustering folder, with detailed explanations andÂ visualizations.
