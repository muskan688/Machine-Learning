### K-Means Clustering - Machine Learning Project

Overview

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into K distinct clusters. This project applies K-Means to customer segmentation based on Annual Income and Spending Score.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is Mall_Customers.csv, which contains:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Genre: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- Age: Age of the customer.
- Annual Income (k$): Customer’s yearly income.
- Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the shopping mall based on spending behavior.

### Project Workflow

- Load & Explore Data
- Visualize Dataset
- Determine Optimal Clusters (Elbow Method)
- Train K-Means Model
- Evaluate & Visualize Clusters
