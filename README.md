## Machine Learning Models

Overview

This repository contains implementations of various **Classification, Regression, Clustering** algorithms in Python using Scikit-Learn. These models are trained on the different datasets to predict different things.

-- The Classification methods included in this repository are:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Kernel SVM
- Naïve Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

-- The Regression methods included in this repository are:

- Decision Tree Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Simple Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression


-- The Clustering methods included in this repository are:

- Hierarchical Clustering
- K-meand Clusteing
- Combine Clustering Jupyter ntebook


Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook inside the classification folder, with detailed explanations and visualizations.
