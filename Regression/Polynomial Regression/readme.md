## Polynomial Regression

Overview

This project implements Polynomial Regression, an extension of Linear Regression that fits a curved relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Instead of a straight-line equation, it models data using polynomial terms:

             Y = b0+ b1X+ b2X2+ b3X3+ ... +bnXn

 
This allows for better fitting of non-linear data compared to standard linear regression.

Features

- Captures non-linear relationships between variables.
- Uses higher-degree polynomial terms to fit the curve.
- Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) & RÂ² Score.
- Visualizes regression curves to show the effect of polynomial transformations.
