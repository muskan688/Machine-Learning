## Regression Algorithms (Machine Learning)

Overview
This repository explores different regression techniques to analyze and predict numerical outcomes based on input variables.

Included Models
- Simple Linear Regression – One independent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression – Multiple independent variables.
- Decision Tree Regression – Uses tree-based decision rules.
- Random Forest Regression – Ensemble of multiple trees for better predictions.
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) – Uses hyperplanes for regression.

Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
