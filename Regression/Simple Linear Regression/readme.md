## Simple Linear Regression

Overview
This project implements Simple Linear Regression to establish a relationship between a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y).

Features
- Uses one predictor to estimate an output.
- Fits a straight-line equation:
               Y = mX+b
- Evaluates performance using R² Score & Mean Squared Error (MSE).
